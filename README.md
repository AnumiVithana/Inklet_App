Guidelines to run the Application

Download the project and open it on Intellij Idea Ultimate.
Create a PostgreSQL database named “inklet_db”.
Check the port which the server of PostgreSQL is running.  
Go to the application.properties file.
In the file, the database configuration is set to port 5433. If it is different from your server port, then change it.
Check the database name on the URL. (No need to check if you have exactly used the same database name as above).
Set your username and password for PostgreSQL.
Run the “InkletApplication” file.
Visit a web browser and find the URL http://localhost:8080/login. Then, you will obtain the front end view.
